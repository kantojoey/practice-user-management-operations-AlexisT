This lesson was very helpful as far as increasing my comfort with joins, although I definitely have to give it a lot of thought when thinking about how to write the joins in the write order to ensure the tables are joined in the way I want. Something I have uncertainty about is what the pros/cons are between WHERE and HAVING clauses and I wish the lesson had touched on this because it seems to me they do the same thing except the filtering happens at different stages. I can see WHERE clauses being useful in large datasets because it reduces the amount of items that are analyzed before any aggregation is done, but otherwise I'm not sure what is the best use case for each.
